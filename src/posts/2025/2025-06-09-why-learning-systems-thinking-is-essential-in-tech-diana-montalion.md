I recently listened to Diana Montalion's insightful conversation on the [Tech Lead Journal podcast](https://techleadjournal.dev/episodes/219/) about systems thinking in technology. She shares her perspective on how relationships between components create effects and why it is important to have this holistic view.

Some takeaways from the conversation include:

### What is systems thinking?

At its core, a system is a set of interconnected components whose relationships produce outcomes that individual parts cannot achieve alone. Systems thinking means understanding these relationships to architect desired effects. As Montalion explains:

> Relationships produce effect. Systems thinking is understanding the effect and being able to architect for the kinds of effects we want in a system.

This approach requires considering multiple levels simultaneously—from code implementation to business outcomes. We need this holistic view to communicate clearly with all stakeholders, secure alignment, obtain funding, and achieve shared goals.

### The need for collaboration

Importantly, no single person can master all perspectives. Partnering becomes essential:

> Your skills are insufficient in the modern world. You can know everything about JavaScript there is to know. But if you do not know how to make people's lives better with JavaScript, how much value are you really bringing?

### The benefits of modeling

Modeling emerges as a powerful tool to bridge understanding gaps:

> We often think we're solving the same problem, and when we're going around and around, usually it is because we have completely different mental models. Including visual elements—moving things around, making relationships—helps.

I particularly appreciated Montalion's practical advice on architectural decision records. I do not know if I need to laugh or cry here, as I have encountered ADRs that lacked this depth:

> A thing that stands out to me often is that people do not describe other options they considered. They are just recording the decision.

Her emphasis on "yes, and" collaboration and systemic reasoning provides actionable methods to implement these concepts. The full conversation offers insights for developers or anyone building (technical) systems.
