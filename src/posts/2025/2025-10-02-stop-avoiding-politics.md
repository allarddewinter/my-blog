The post [Stop Avoiding Politics](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/10/01/stop-avoiding-politics/) from Terrible Software tackles a common aversion among engineers: workplace politics. The author argues that dismissing politics as a "dirty game" is a strategic mistake. The core problem isn't politics itself, but *bad* politics. By refusing to participate, well-intentioned engineers cede influence, allowing poor decisions to be made without their input.

Perspective like this and other on influencing link to the realities of power explored in Niccolò Machiavelli's *The Prince*. Written as a guide for acquiring and maintaining political power, its lessons are surprisingly applicable to modern organisational dynamics.

Politics, in this context, is simply the mechanism of human coordination within groups—the network of relationships, influence, and informal power present in every organisation.

> Good politics is just being strategic about relationships and influence in the service of good outcomes.

The author contrasts two mindsets: the engineer who avoids politics and complains about bad decisions, and the engineer who understands that "ideas don’t speak. People do." The latter engages in what is often reframed as "stakeholder management" or "building alignment," which are essentially political skills used for positive ends.

## Machiavellian Principles for Modern Influence

Machiavelli's work provides a foundational theory for understanding why engaging with politics is necessary. His central argument is that a leader must be pragmatic, understanding the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.

| Machiavellian Concept | Application in Modern Organisations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Virtù vs. Fortuna** | Relying on skill and ability (`virtù`) to navigate chance and circumstance (`fortuna`), rather than hoping merit alone will suffice. |
| **The Importance of Appearances** | Managing perception and being visible, ensuring good work is recognised. |
| **It is Better to be Feared than Loved** | Translated to a corporate context: being respected for your competence and reliability is more durable than being liked. |
| **The Lion and the Fox** | Combining the strength of the lion (technical competence) with the cunning of the fox (political acumen) to be effective. |

## Good Politics in Practice

The article provides concrete examples of what constructive political engagement looks like, which align with these principles:

*   **Building relationships before you need them:** A casual coffee with a colleague from another team can turn them into a valuable ally months later. This is an exercise in building a base of support, a key Machiavellian strategy.
*   **Understanding real incentives:** Framing technical proposals in terms of what decision-makers actually care about (e.g., shipping speed, not microservices architecture). This is pragmatism—understanding what truly motivates people.
*   **Managing up effectively:** Keeping managers informed and presenting solutions, not just problems, to build trust. This strengthens your position and influence (`virtù`).
*   **Creating win-win situations:** Finding ways to collaborate that benefit multiple parties instead of engaging in zero-sum fights for resources. This secures alliances and stabilises your position.
*   **Being visible:** Ensuring that good work is seen and recognised through presentations, documentation, and communication. This is the modern equivalent of managing your reputation and appearances.

The alternative to good politics isn't no politics. It’s bad politics winning by default. The choice mirrors the dilemma Machiavelli presents: to engage with the messy reality of power or to be governed by it. Leading and influencing from where you stand, without formal authority, is the essence of practical leadership. Giving it our all means mastering the art of influence to champion good ideas and protect our teams, embracing the pragmatism that has been necessary for effective action for centuries.
