I came across this nice article from First Round Review, and it offers simple and easy to apply small things you can do to make life better for the people around you in your company. I like that it is not (only) about grand gestures, but about the consistent, small habits that build trust and empower people. 

The original article, [The 25 Micro-Habits of High-Impact Managers](https://review.firstround.com/the-25-micro-habits-of-high-impact-managers/), is well worth a full read.

The piece lists 25 habits, and I have included them all below. A few, in particular, stood out to me because I either appreciate them in a manager or try to practise them myself. 

1.  Don't swerve around a debate.
2.  Be generous with your ideas.
3.  Think of yourself as the team captain, not the head coach.
4.  Set the tone with cross-functional partners.
5.  Write down what makes you tick.
6.  Shine a light on failure.
7.  Pull back the curtain.
8.  Make space for reflection.
9.  Reserve time for thinking outside the box.
10. Find the connective tissue.
11. Resist the urge to multitask.
    > *This means being fully present in conversations, especially 1:1s, showing your team they have your undivided attention.*
12. Follow up and follow through.
    > *It highlights the importance of consistency and reliability, closing loops on open items to build trust.*
13. Don't forget the humans behind the company's goals.
14. Encourage folks to put themselves first.
15. Cushion the blows.
16. Create a monthly performance review action plan.
    > *This turns annual feedback into a continuous, actionable process with regular check-ins on progress.*
17. Reinforce good habits.
18. Take a beat before delivering feedback.
19. Look for opportunities to praise in the moment.
20. Spot chances to send kudos up the chain.
21. Celebrate moments outside of the office, too.
22. Invest in their career.
    > *A great manager actively helps people get to the next step, seeing the current role as just one part of their journey.*
23. Bring in mentors and skip-levels.
24. Make space for growth.
    > *This involves actively checking in on a person's well-being and career goals to ensure they do not feel stuck.*
25. Sharpen your arrows.
