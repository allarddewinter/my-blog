Simon Willison recently linked to a Reddit thread asking users for the most profitable things they have done with ChatGPT. The responses offer a overview, if anecdotal, showing how people are using these tools for practical, everyday value.

The definition of "profit" in these threads is broad. While some users report direct income, the more pervasive theme is using the tool to reclaim valueâ€”either by drastically cutting costs on professional services, automating time-consuming tasks, or gaining leverage in disputes. The tool effectively acts as an on-demand expert, a patient tutor, or an administrative assistant.

The responses generally fall into a few key categories.

### Legal and contractual disputes

One of the most frequent applications is using the tool to understand and draft communication for legal or quasi-legal situations. It helps level the playing field against companies with dedicated legal teams.

*   Drafting letters to contest insurance claim denials.
*   Challenging unfair rental lease agreements or move-out fees by citing tenancy laws.
*   Negotiating with landlords over issues like a lack of heating by referencing building codes.
*   Getting out of unfair dismissal claims or securing unpaid bonuses.
*   Helping to write grant proposals that secure funding.

### Professional and work efficiency

Many users leverage ChatGPT to augment their professional skills, automate tedious tasks, and advance their careers.

*   Writing VBA macros for Excel to automate data processing.
*   Drafting well-structured performance reviews to secure raises.
*   Helping to write and debug code, especially for unfamiliar languages or systems.
*   Creating entire business systems, like interconnecting a SaaS app with a legacy VoIP server, saving thousands in development costs.
*   Preparing for job interviews by role-playing questions and answers.

### Personal finance and cost savings

A huge category of use is simple, direct cost avoidance through DIY projects and better negotiations.

*   Diagnosing and fixing household appliances like HVAC systems, garage doors, and ovens.
*   Troubleshooting car problems to avoid expensive mechanic visits.
*   Learning local electrical codes to perform home wiring projects, saving thousands on electricians.
*   Negotiating better prices on new cars by analysing fees and comparing offers.
*   Keeping swimming pools chemically balanced without a professional service.

> Electrician wanted $6,000 to wire my sauna (long run through the attic, then down an exterior wall and underground for ~30ft). Chat helped me figure out the electrical code and I did it myself for $600 and passed inspection on first try.

### Health and wellbeing

While risky if taken as gospel, many use AI as a first-line research tool for health issues, often leading to better outcomes.

*   Diagnosing conditions in pets and humans by providing symptoms, prompting a second opinion from a real doctor.
*   Identifying potentially harmful drug interactions that were missed by doctors or pharmacies.
*   Acting as a "trauma dump" or a therapy tool for self-reflection and emotional processing.
*   Creating personalised workout and nutrition plans.

> It hasnâ€™t paid me in cash yet, but itâ€™s paid me in growth. Using ChatGPT for self-development has sharpened my emotional awareness and helped me process what I feel. I use it as a catalyst, not a crutch.

### Entrepreneurship and side hustles

For those building something new, ChatGPT serves as a co-founder, assistant, and creative partner.

*   Building and launching iOS apps or SaaS websites with little to no prior coding knowledge.
*   Writing and self-publishing textbooks or e-books.
*   Generating business ideas and developing marketing strategies.
*   Creating storyboards and scripts for creative projects.

### Learning and self-development

The tool is widely used as a personal tutor to acquire new skills or understand complex topics.

*   Studying for professional certifications and university degrees.
*   Learning to code, invest, or perform complex data analysis.
*   Understanding personal finance concepts like setting up an IRA.
*   Helping to manage ADHD by creating schedules and organisational systems.

### My takeaway

The overarching theme is one of empowerment. The tool gives individuals access to specialised knowledge that was previously hard or expensive to obtain. It acts as a powerful sparring partner for thinking through complex problems, whether that is a business strategy, a legal argument, or a DIY project.

At least part of the value seems to come from using it as an intelligent starting point. It can organise your thoughts, highlight what you do not know, and provide a structured path for further, more focused research. For many, it is a tool that reduces friction and provides the confidence to tackle challenges that would otherwise seem insurmountable.
