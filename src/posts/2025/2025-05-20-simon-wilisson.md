Thanks to Simon Willison, you are now reading this blog. He is the one who inspired me to get my own site up and running and publish here instead of using one of the social media giants. His personal website, [simonwillison.net](https://simonwillison.net/), nicely demonstrates the value of owning your digital narrative and sharing knowledge freely.

>Simon Willison is the creator of Datasette, an open source tool for exploring and publishing data. He currently works full-time building open source tools for data journalism, built around Datasette and SQLite.
>
>Prior to becoming an independent open source developer, Simon was an engineering director at Eventbrite. Simon joined Eventbrite through their acquisition of Lanyrd, a Y Combinator funded company he co-founded in 2010.
>
>He is a co-creator of the Django Web Framework, and has been blogging about web development and programming since 2002 at simonwillison.net.

## Inspiration for Coding and Learning

Beyond inspiring me to build my own platform, Simon is also an exceptional coder. His dedication inspires me to write better code and continue coding myself, even as my career progresses and coding might be less expected.

I particularly appreciate how he shares his deep dives into Large Language Models (LLMs), practical coding techniques, and technology trends. These provide really good insight and overview, and inspire me to experiment and build things myself.

## Contributing to Society

He also inspires me to contribute to a better society. His work supporting the press with his Datasette tooling and workshops is a great example of using technology for public good.

Overall, Simon Willison's technical expertise, commitment to open source, and focus on using technology for positive impact makes him an inspiring person!
