I am not a natural networker, so I was glad to find this practical breakdown on the topic. While I recognise the benefits, it is an area where I would like to grow. The article from Stay SaaSy, "[Networking For People Who Don't Network](https://staysaasy.com/networking/2024/12/11/networking-for-people-who-dont-network.html)", offers some excellent, down-to-earth advice.

They compare networking to working out: a small, consistent effort can yield significant benefits.

> The #1 missed opportunity in networking is failing to take the achingly simple steps to build a network from people you work with every day.

### A summary of their heuristics

Here is a scannable summary of their main points:

*   **Start with your coworkers**: This is your most accessible and high-quality network. Be competent, a good teammate, and positive.
*   **It is a numbers game**: Meet many people without the pressure of making every connection a deep one.
*   **Find what works for you**: Choose events you genuinely enjoy, whether that is small dinners or specific meetups, rather than forcing yourself into environments you dislike.
*   **Nurture your network**: A simple "thinking of you" message or a semi-regular in-person meeting keeps relationships alive.
*   **Do not act weird**: Avoid common pitfalls like asking someone to be your mentor on the first meeting or bragging.

I also found this point about workplace positivity very true:

> Winners are inspired by ambition and shared victories, and complaining is pretty much the polar opposite.
