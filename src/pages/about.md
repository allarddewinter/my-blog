## What I Do

My professional life is all about leveraging technology and strategic thinking to build robust, practical solutions. I primarily work within the energy sector across Europe, and I even had the opportunity to work in Rwanda and Madagascar. What really drives me is sustainability, using data and smart architecture to create real, positive change.

As a Technical Authority and Domain Architect, I see my role as bridging the gap between what's technically possible and what the business truly needs. This means I help shape technology roadmaps, establish clear governance, and apply my background in data analytics, data science, and cloud platforms to build systems that are not just effective, but also scalable for the future.

I like breaking down complex problems, looking beyond existing boundaries, and providing clear insights. These insights always come from understanding not just the technical possibilities, but also the true business needs and value. 

## Why this site exists

For years, I have been collecting interesting links from colleagues, newsletters, podcasts, and general browsing. My system was simple: save them in my browser's bookmarks or a OneNote file with a brief note. While functional, this approach felt incomplete. The context was often lost, and the knowledge remained siloed and private.

This website is my solution. It serves as a personal knowledge blog or, more accurately, an **elaborate public bookmarking tool**. I wanted to create a space not just to save a link, but to document *why* it captured my attention. Here, I add summaries, pull out key ideas, and share my own perspective on the topic. It is a place for me to process my thoughts, document my learnings, and explore subjects more deeply.

My primary audience is my future self. This site is part of my digital garden, a knowledge base I can return to and build upon over time. However, by making it public, I hope it also proves useful to others who stumble upon it.

The content is shaped by a few key inspirations: the linkblogging style of **Simon Willison** for technology, the strategic thinking of **Will Larsen**, and the positive mindset philosophy of **Michael Pilarczyk**. Following their lead, I focus on the intersection of technology, strategy, and mindset. My goal is to explore the principles behind building robust systems (in both organisations and technology), making effective decisions, and cultivating a resilient, optimistic outlook.

This is a space to bring clarity to complex areas and share the resources and ideas that I find valuable.
