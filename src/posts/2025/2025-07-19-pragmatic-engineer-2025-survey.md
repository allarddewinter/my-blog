I always appreciate articles like the annual survey from The Pragmatic Engineer. They provide a great overview of what is currently being used across the industry. It is a good way to get ideas about what other people are using and to discover tools you might not have heard of. After reading this year's edition, I have definitely found one or two new tools that I am going to try out.

You can read the full, detailed survey here: [The Pragmatic Engineer 2025 Survey](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey).

Below are a few of my key takeaways.

### The rise of AI and 'vibe coding' tools

It is no surprise that AI tools are prominent, but the speed of change is remarkable. While **GitHub Copilot** remains extremely popular, the survey shows that newer tools like **Cursor** are gaining ground very quickly. It is also interesting to see **Claude** closing the gap with **ChatGPT**.

The article also mentions several "vibe coding" tools, such as **Vercel v0** and **Bolt.new**. These seem to be aimed at less technical audiences who want to create prototypes or mockups quickly. It confirms that there is a growing market for tools that assist non-developers in bringing ideas to life, which I guess makes a lot of sense.

### A surprise in the IDE landscape

I was genuinely surprised to see how popular JetBrains' suite of IDEs is. I had the impression they were a much smaller player in the market, but the survey data shows they are a strong competitor to Microsoft's offerings like **VS Code**. 

### The most-loved and most-hated tools

One of the most hated tools is **JIRA**, by a large margin. The main complaints are that it is slow, complex, and cumbersome. On the other hand, tools like **Linear**, **VS Code**, and the **JetBrains** IDEs receive a lot of positive mentions. It seems that developers value speed and simplicity above all else.

Overall, the survey is a valuable snapshot of the current state of developer tooling. It is a great resource for anyone looking to understand current trends or discover new tools to improve their workflow.
