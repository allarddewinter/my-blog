I came across an article on the Stay SaaSy blog about the important, and often delicate, task of setting company policies.

You can read the full piece here: [Setting Startup Policies](https://staysaasy.com/management/2025/05/05/setting-startup-policies.html).

What I particularly appreciate is its clear perspective, which applies not just to startups but to any company. It covers the entire lifecycle of a policy, from its birth to its eventual dead. The author frames policy-setting as a core executive function and provides a set of practical rules to follow.

The article makes several valuable points, which I have summarised below:

*   **Treat policies like products.** A policy needs to be well-designed to avoid unintended consequences. This involves using existing solutions as a starting point, getting wide feedback before release, and rolling them out progressively.
    > The best way to ensure that your policies make sense from top to bottom is to treat them like products.
*   **Ensure full transparency.** Secret exceptions or loopholes erode trust quickly. The author suggests an "all hands test": if you would be nervous explaining the entire policy, including its exceptions, to the whole company, it needs to be rethought.
*   **Do not punish good behaviour.** Policies should never create a situation where following the rules puts someone at a disadvantage. For example, a "use-it-or-lose-it" budget can punish teams that are fiscally responsible.
*   **Allow for evolution.** The people most affected by a policy must have a way to influence its change. A policy should not become a fixed rule that harms one group to benefit another.
*   **Use them sparingly.** Creating policies can be a form of false productivity. It adds friction and can slow people down. Healthy organisations focus on pruning and automating rules that are no longer needed.
    > Many teams confuse creating policies with adding value â€“ one of the most toxic mistakes that an organization can allow.

Helpful post for setting guardrails effectively.
