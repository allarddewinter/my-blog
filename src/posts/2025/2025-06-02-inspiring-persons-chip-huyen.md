Chip Huyen, whose work is available on her [personal website](https://huyenchip.com/), demonstrates a structured and strategic approach to career and personal development. This aligns with principles of positive mindset and self-direction, as discussed by Michael Pilarczyk in my earlier post on him: [Inspiring Persons: Michael Pilarczyk](https://allarddewinter.net/blog/inspiring-persons-michael-pilarczyk-part-1/). She has a consistent method of exploring complex topics, synthesising information, and presenting it for others to learn from through her blog, books, and courses.

Her perspectives on personal growth, detailed in her blog post "Measuring personal growth" ([https://huyenchip.com/2024/04/17/personal-growth.html](https://huyenchip.com/2024/04/17/personal-growth.html)), reflect an analytical approach to self-improvement. She discusses metrics such as the rate of change in life, the time taken to work on significant challenges, and the expansion of future options. This quantitative view of personal development shares common ground with Michael Pilarczyk's "Master Your Mindset" in its emphasis on intentional growth and proactive problem-solving. As she writes in her blog post:
> As someone lowkey fascinated by numbers, I don’t see why measuring and living have to be mutually exclusive – measuring often helps me live better – but I see where they come from.
Both perspectives support this deliberate and intentional approach to personal development.

From a professional standpoint, her [Stanford course, CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/), has been especially a valuable resource to me:

*   Lecture 9, on "Model Deployment," provided insights into batch versus online prediction. (While "streaming" is often used for real-time data processing, "online prediction" is the term used in the course for synchronous, on-demand predictions.) It helped structure my understanding of our team's needs at the time, where batch prediction was sufficient, and provided considerations for future transitions to online prediction, with possible real-time needs. The discussion also covered implications for future applications involving edge computing, such as models deployed on wind turbines.
*   Lecture 10, covering "Data Distribution Shifts and Monitoring," was especially relevant to my industry. In the context of wind turbines, component wear can lead to shifts in nominal values. Moreover, this lecture highlighted the importance of monitoring practices, including setting alerts and establishing notification channels, to detect such shifts and maintain model performance. These materials were subsequently applied to implement relevant processes and tools in my professional role.

In addition to her course, Chip Huyen has authored two books. "Designing Machine Learning Systems" (O’Reilly, 2022), derived from her Stanford course, provides a comprehensive view of ML system development. Her book, "AI Engineering" (O’Reilly, 2025), covers the development and deployment of applications using foundation models. Summaries for both books are accessible on her [GitHub](https://github.com/chiphuyen).

Finally, her contributions as a woman in technology are noteworthy, particularly in the context of ongoing industry efforts towards diversity. Her work demonstrates a combination of technical expertise and a methodical approach to problem-solving. Very inspirational!
