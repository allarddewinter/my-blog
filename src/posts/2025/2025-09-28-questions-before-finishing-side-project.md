As someone balancing screen-based work with hands-on hobbies like woodworking and family life with three children, I often face the dilemma of when to continue with a side project versus when to let it go. Cassidy Williams, a software engineer based in Chicago, offers a concise framework for navigating this common challenge in her article [Questions to ask when you think need to finish something](https://cassidoo.co/post/questions-when-i-need-to-finish-something/).

Williams identifies six key questions for conducting a "mental audit" of ongoing projects. These help distinguish between genuine commitment and obligation-driven persistence:

1. **Does this still align with my current goals?**  
   Reassess whether the project serves your present priorities, not past aspirations.

2. **Would I start this again without prior investment?**  
   Imagine beginning fresh—would you choose this project today?

3. **Do I want this, or am I proving I can finish it?**  
   Separate intrinsic motivation from completion pressure.

4. **What happens if I let this go?**  
   Acknowledge potential consequences without emotional bias.

5. **Am I meeting my expectations or others'?**  
   Identify whether external validation drives your effort.

6. **What would I pursue instead?**  
   Clarify opportunities created by releasing the project.

> Doing a little “mental audit” around projects have helped me ship better when I realize some projects I pursue aren’t actually worth it to me.

This approach resonates with my experience of alternating between laptop work and tangible activities like woodworking. The physical immediacy of sawing wood or sanding surfaces provides a stark contrast to digital work, making me more intentional about where I invest limited time. Similarly, parenting three children teaches me to prioritise what truly matters—often revealing that "finishing" isn’t the goal, but rather aligning effort with life's context.
