I am currently taking the [Introduction to Systems Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/systems-engineering) course from UNSW Sydney. According to the course description, it "uses a structured yet flexible approach to provide a holistic, solid foundation to the successful development of complicated systems." It covers the entire system life cycle, from design and development to production and management, explaining how different components interrelate to achieve a project's goals.

While the video lectures are informative, I find the accompanying study materials can be quite basic and sometimes lack the depth I am looking for. To overcome this and engage with the subject matter, I have developed a workflow that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as a personal study companion.

### Why I use an AI assistant for studying

My approach serves two main purposes.

1.  **To add depth:** The standard course materials do not always contain all the information I need. An assistant can help fill in the gaps and provide a more comprehensive overview.
2.  **To improve learning:** Interacting with the theory is crucial for my understanding and retention. This process forces me to synthesise information, which is a more effective way to learn than passive reading.

### My study workflow

My process transforms fragmented course content into a structured and coherent study guide in OneNote. It involves a few key steps and some custom tools.

1.  **Gathering the raw materials**
    First, I collect all the available information for a course module. This includes video captions, lecture notes, and any provided handouts in PDF format. To handle the PDFs, I use a tool I created, the [PDF to Markdown Converter](https://allarddewinter.github.io/pdf-to-markdown-converter/), which I wrote about in a [previous post](https://allarddewinter.net/blog/building-a-pdf-to-markdown-converter-with-vibe-coding/).

2.  **The AI study companion**
    Next, I feed all this raw text into an LLM. After some experimenting, I have settled on using Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro for generating the study guides. I found that other models had drawbacks for this specific task; Claude 4 Sonnet was often too talkative, DeepSeek R1 was too brief, and Gemini 2.5 Flash was not detailed enough. The quality of the output, however, depends almost entirely on the prompt.

3.  **Structuring the notes for OneNote**
    The LLM generates a well-structured overview in Markdown. To get this into my preferred note-taking application, I use another tool I built: the [Markdown to OneNote Converter](https://allarddewinter.github.io/markdown-to-onenote/). This tool, which I also [posted about earlier](https://allarddewinter.net/blog/building-a-pdf-to-markdown-converter-with-vibe-coding/), converts the Markdown into formatted text that I can paste directly into a OneNote page.

4.  **Final touches**
    As a final step, I manually review the generated guide and copy over the most important diagrams and slides from the original materials. This step ensures the visual information is not lost and serves as another engagement with the theory.

### Crafting the perfect prompt

The heart of this workflow is the prompt. A good prompt is the difference between a generic summary and a truly useful study guide. I collaborated with Claude 4 Sonnet to develop and refine my prompt.

Here is a summary of that development process:

> **Initial Goal:** Create an AI agent to synthesise video content and poor-quality handouts into comprehensive, exam-ready study materials for my Systems Engineering course.
>
> **Evolution:**
> - **Version 1: Comprehensive Foundation.** Established the agent's identity and a detailed output structure.
> - **Version 2: Course-Centric Focus.** Shifted priority to the course's specific learning objectives and improved diagram preferences.
> - **Version 3: Holistic Integration.** Moved from separate content blocks to a unified, flowing narrative for better retention.
> - **Version 4: Enhanced Learning Techniques.** Added metacognitive support, concept mapping, and comparative analysis to deepen understanding.
>
> **Final Agent Characteristics:** The final prompt defines an elite Systems Engineering educator that transforms fragmented materials into a single, integrated study guide focused on clarity, retention, and the course's specific goals.

### The final prompt: My systems engineering master educator

This iterative process resulted in the following detailed prompt, which I now use to generate my study guides that help me understand the theory.

**Systems Engineering Master Educator & Study Companion**

## **Your Core Identity**
You are an elite Systems Engineering educator with 20+ years of experience in both academic instruction and real-world systems implementation. You have taught at top-tier universities, consulted for Fortune 500 companies, and have deep expertise in systems thinking, requirements engineering, system architecture, verification & validation, and lifecycle management. You are passionate about making complex systems concepts crystal clear and intuitive for students.

## **Your Mission**
Transform poorly structured course materials into a **unified, holistic study guide** that flows seamlessly from concept to application to exam preparation. You will receive handout text and video captions from an "Introduction to Systems Engineering" course and synthesize them into a **single, integrated learning experience** that ensures deep understanding and academic success.

## **Your Primary Approach**

### **Course-Centric Analysis**
- **Extract and prioritize** the explicit learning objectives from the provided course materials
- **Map course content structure** to identify the intended learning progression
- **Identify gaps** in the provided materials and fill them with pedagogically sound content
- **Align everything** to the course's specific goals, terminology, and emphasis areas
- **Supplement strategically** only when course content is incomplete or unclear

### **Holistic Integration Philosophy**
- **Seamless narrative flow** - Weave concepts, examples, applications, and study aids into one coherent story
- **Natural progression** - Let each idea build organically into the next
- **Integrated learning** - Embed real-world examples, memory aids, and exam insights throughout the explanation
