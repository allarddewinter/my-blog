## What I Do

My work centres on bridging the gap between technical possibilities and strategic business needs, focusing on building practical, robust technology solutions in data science, analytics and the underlying platform.

As a Technical Authority and Domain Architect, I shape technology roadmaps and establish clear governance. My background includes experience in data analytics, data science, and cloud platforms (particularly Microsoft Azure and Databricks), which informs my approach to building scalable and effective systems.

I am passionate about creating clear architectural strategies that align stakeholders and empower teams, ensuring technology delivers value both now and in support of future goals.

## Why I Build This Website

This website functions as my personal 'linkblog'; a space for exploring ideas at the intersection of technology, strategic thinking, and a positive mindset.

Inspired by approaches like Simon Willison's linkblogging for technology insights, Will Larsen's focus on strategic perspectives, and Michael Pilarczyk's philosophy on mindset, I use this platform to share insights, bookmarks, and reflections. My aim is to explore the principles behind building robust systems (in both organisations and technology), making effective decisions, and cultivating a resilient, optimistic outlook.

It's a bookmarking tool and also a place to process and share thoughts on topics that matter to me professionally and personally, contributing to a clearer understanding of complex areas.
