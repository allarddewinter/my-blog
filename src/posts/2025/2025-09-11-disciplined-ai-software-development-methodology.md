Collaborating with Large Language Models (LLMs) on software development can be highly effective, but it often introduces problems like architectural drift and context dilution. The [Disciplined AI Software Development methodology](https://github.com/Varietyz/Disciplined-AI-Software-Development) by Jay Baleine offers a structured approach to mitigate these issues by imposing systematic constraints on the AI-human interaction.

> The methodology addresses common issues like code bloat, architectural drift, and context dilution through systematic constraints and validation checkpoints.

The core problem it identifies is that AI systems operate on a simple "Question → Answer" pattern. When given broad, multi-faceted requests, they tend to produce code that lacks structure, contains repetition, and drifts from the intended architecture over time.

### The Four Stages of the Methodology

The approach is broken down into four distinct stages, designed to build upon each other with clear validation points.

1.  **AI Configuration:** The process begins by providing the AI with custom instructions (e.g., `AI-PREFERENCES.XML`) that establish behavioural constraints. This includes instructing the AI to flag any uncertainty, ensuring it does not "hallucinate" solutions when it lacks sufficient information.
2.  **Collaborative Planning:** The developer and AI work together to define the project's scope, components, dependencies, and phases. This structured planning session results in a development plan with clear modular boundaries and measurable checkpoints.
3.  **Systematic Implementation:** Development proceeds phase by phase, with each request focused on a single, specific component. A key constraint is a strict file size limit (e.g., ≤150 lines) to maintain small context windows, enforce focused implementation, and simplify debugging.
4.  **Data-Driven Iteration:** A benchmarking suite is built first (Phase 0). Performance data from this suite is fed back to the AI, ensuring that optimisation decisions are based on empirical measurements rather than assumptions.

### Architectural Guardrails for AI Collaboration

The principles outlined in this methodology can be viewed as tactical architectural guardrails, similar in spirit to the high-level principles found in frameworks like TOGAF.[^1]

Where TOGAF provides a strategic framework for enterprise architecture, these rules provide a micro-framework for AI code generation. Constraints like the 150-line file limit and single-component implementation are not arbitrary; they enforce modularity and prevent the AI from making sprawling, unmanaged changes. This approach transforms the AI from an unpredictable partner into a disciplined builder that adheres to a pre-defined architectural vision.

The repository includes practical tools to support this workflow, such as example configuration files and a Python script (`project_extract.py`) for generating structured snapshots of the codebase to share with the AI.

By enforcing a systematic process, the developer's role shifts from constantly debugging inconsistent output to strategically planning the work and validating the results. It is a practical framework for turning an AI into a more reliable and predictable development partner.
