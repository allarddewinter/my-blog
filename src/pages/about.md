## What I Do

My professional life is all about leveraging technology and strategic thinking to build robust, practical solutions. I primarily work within the energy sector across Europe, and I even had the opportunity to work in Rwanda and Madagascar. What really drives me is sustainability, using data and smart architecture to create real, positive change.

As a Technical Authority and Domain Architect, I see my role as bridging the gap between what's technically possible and what the business truly needs. This means I help shape technology roadmaps, establish clear governance, and apply my background in data analytics, data science, and cloud platforms to build systems that are not just effective, but also scalable for the future.

I like breaking down complex problems, looking beyond existing boundaries, and providing clear insights. These insights always come from understanding not just the technical possibilities, but also the true business needs and value.

## Why I Build This Website

This website functions as my personal 'linkblog'; a space for exploring ideas at the intersection of technology, strategic thinking, and a positive mindset.

Inspired by approaches like Simon Willison's linkblogging for technology insights, Will Larsen's focus on strategic perspectives, and Michael Pilarczyk's philosophy on mindset, I use this platform to share insights, bookmarks, and reflections. My aim is to explore the principles behind building robust systems (in both organisations and technology), making effective decisions, and cultivating a resilient, optimistic outlook.

It's a bookmarking tool and also a place to process and share thoughts on topics that matter to me professionally and personally, contributing to a clearer understanding of complex areas.
