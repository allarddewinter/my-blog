I frequently listen to the Jocko Podcast. While I have no military background, I recognise that military history offers a rich source of knowledge on leadership and effectiveness. The concepts discussed can be applied not just in conflict, but also in business—a principle the hosts, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin, have built their company on.[^1] They are effective at explaining these ideas, using real examples from their combat experience to ground abstract principles in reality.

A clear example of this is [Jocko Podcast episode 251](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrlpv1HkKjM). In it, Jocko and Leif discuss a rare book that heavily influenced their philosophy: *Guidelines for the Leader and Commander* by General Bruce C. Clarke. This book was also a key source for Colonel David Hackworth, an important influence on Jocko's thinking. The episode traces the lineage of their core ideas back to this foundational text.

### Key Principles from 'Guidelines for the Leader and Commander'

The podcast discussion centres on the timeless nature of the book's advice. The principles, written decades ago, are the same ones Jocko and Leif now teach.

*   **The Burden of Command:** Leadership requires immense personal sacrifice and a willingness to devote yourself entirely to your team and mission. It means accepting total responsibility for the failures of your subordinates, a core tenet of Extreme Ownership.
*   **What a Team Expects from a Leader:** General Clarke outlines several non-negotiable expectations. A leader must be honest, just, and fair. They must be loyal to both superiors and subordinates. They must lead by example, share information by explaining the "why," and show genuine interest in their people's well-being.
*   **Setting and Enforcing Standards:** The leader is directly responsible for the standards of the organisation. This is captured in two of the book's most important axioms, which Jocko had sought for years. The first connects preparation to performance, and the second highlights the necessity of inspection.
    > An organisation does well only those things the boss checks.
*   **Morale is Built on Competence:** High morale is not achieved through coddling. It is the direct result of confidence built through hard training, competence, and effective management. A team that is well-trained and well-led develops pride and resilience.
*   **Constant Vigilance:** A core theme is that a unit must be ready for anything, 24/7. General Clarke warns against the complacency that led to surprise attacks in the past. This principle of constant readiness is a cornerstone of the Jocko and Leif mindset.

### The 'Normal Face' Principle: Emotional Regulation in Leadership

A powerful, practical tool discussed in the episode is what Jocko and Leif call "Normal Face." It is the practiced ability to control your external emotional response to project calmness and focus, especially when faced with bad news or chaos. It is not about being emotionless, but about emotional discipline.

When a subordinate reports a significant mistake, a leader's calm, measured response is often more effective than an angry outburst. It keeps the focus on solving the problem rather than assigning blame. As Leif explains, Jocko’s composed reaction to a serious error provided a sense of comfort and made the situation feel manageable.

> **Jocko:** "...if I can't control my emotions because you lost a piece of gear... like how am I going to react in the future?... The punishment for me is knowing like it's constructive because I know like I gotta get this fixed we can't let this happen again this is a massive issue... as opposed to me just saddling you with unbearable guilt for letting me down."
> **Leif:** "It's actually the worst because if you were like 'dude are you kidding me?'... I would be looking... it would be desirable when Jocko was like 'Roger' and just looks back at you... doesn't give you... a big sense of comfort like okay at least this is manageable?"

By controlling your reaction, you own the environment and prevent panic from spreading. This principle of emotional regulation is not just for high-stakes environments. The hosts suggest that everyday frustrations, such as managing family life, can be training opportunities. Treating each moment as a chance to practice a measured response is a practical way to develop this skill for constant growth.
