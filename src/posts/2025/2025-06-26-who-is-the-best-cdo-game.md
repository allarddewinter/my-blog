I came across a great little game (~4 mins) that lets you test your skills as a Chief Data Officer (CDO) in just four minutes. It is called '[Who is the best CDO?](https://www.whoisthebestcdo.com/)' and was created by Charlotte Ledoux. You can read more about her thoughts on the game in her [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330476177658187777/).

The objective is clear:

> Your goal: balance innovation with compliance, win support across departments, manage data risks, and prove the value of data to the business.
> 
> [...]
> 
> You have to manage the two key indicators: Data Quality and Reputation. But your ultimate goal is to increase the companyâ€™s profit.

My own attempt was interesting. I managed a good score on data quality, but my reputation took a hit. Still, I ended up with a nice profit!

It is a fun challenge. Give it a try and see how you do!
