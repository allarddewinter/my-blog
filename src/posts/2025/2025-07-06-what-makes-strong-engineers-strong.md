I recently read an interesting view from Sean Goedecke: [What makes strong engineers strong?](https://www.seangoedecke.com/what-makes-strong-engineers-strong/). He argues that the difference between a strong engineer and a weaker one is not just technical skill, but a combination of four key traits, which he presents in order of importance.

His perspective is that strong engineers can complete tasks that 'weaker' ones cannot, even with unlimited time. Here is a brief summary of his points.

### 1. Self-belief
This is the foundation. Strong engineers have the confidence to tackle difficult and unfamiliar problems head-on. They believe they can figure it out, which creates a positive feedback loop: taking on hard problems builds confidence, which encourages them to tackle even harder ones. They do not shy away from the most challenging part of a task.

### 2. Pragmatism
Strong engineers focus on shipping solutions that work. They prioritise getting things done over creating a theoretically "perfect" or "elegant" system. Design decisions are judged by their effectiveness, and they are willing to make compromises to deliver a working product.

### 3. Speed
According to Goedecke, strong engineers are always fast workers. This is not about working long hours, but about efficiency and accumulating experience rapidly. Fast execution allows for more experimentation and makes it possible to try ideas with a low chance of success but a high potential reward.

### 4. Technical ability
While essential, technical skill is the final piece of the puzzle. A baseline is necessary, but what matters more is having the *right* technical skills for the job at hand. Goedecke notes that raw intelligence does not always translate to effectiveness; he would rather work with an engineer who is confident and pragmatic than a genius who struggles with those traits.

Goedecke's summary is that it is the combination of these traits that truly defines a strong engineer. It is a good read, and I recommend checking out the full post for his detailed thoughts.
