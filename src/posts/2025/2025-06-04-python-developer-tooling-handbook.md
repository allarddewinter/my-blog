# Python Developer Tooling Handbook

I came across this excellent resource by [Tim Hopper](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/): a comprehensive guide to Python development tools and best practices.

> This is not a book about programming Python. Instead, the goal of this book is to help you understand the ecosystem of tools used to make Python development easier and more productive.

The handbook is structured into four sections:

- Tutorial: Step-by-step guides to improve your Python development experience
- How To: Practical guidance for your Python projects
- Explanation: In-depth understanding of Python development concepts
- Reference: Detailed information about specific tools and concepts

What I particularly appreciate is how it provides detailed explanations of design decisions and tool functionality, complete with code examples and references to relevant PEPs. For instance:

- The [pyproject.toml reference](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/reference/pyproject/) includes example code and relevant standards
- A [blog post on Simple Modern Python](https://pydevtools.com/blog/simple-modern-uv/) highlights modern tooling:

> [...] minimal but essential tools for Python projects:
> - Uses uv for package management
> - Incorporates ruff for linting and formatting (replacing Black and isort)
> - Includes mypy, codespell, and pytest
> - Provides GitHub Actions configuration
> - Uses Copier for template management
> [...]

This would have been incredibly helpful in the past when I struggled with determining which standards to use or what best practices to follow. The book provides a valuable and easy to understand overview of the modern Python development ecosystem.
