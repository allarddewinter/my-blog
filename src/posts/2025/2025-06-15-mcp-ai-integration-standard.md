The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI systems to connect with real-world tools and data sources. Announced on November 25, 2024, MCP acts as a universal bridge between AI models like Claude and external systems such as databases, APIs, and business tools. You can read the [official announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) for more details and access to the GitHub repository.

Arjan Codes recently published an excellent [practical demonstration of MCP implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0QIuI1wpes). Having completed his software architecture course, I appreciate how Arjan delivers clear, practical content from an independent perspective - refreshingly not tied to major cloud providers, which is common in architecture discussions.

## Architectural approaches for MCP implementation
When implementing MCP, developers face key architectural decisions:

| **Approach**          | **Direct Module Access**               | **API Layer Integration**               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Implementation**    | MCP server calls internal modules directly | MCP server interacts with existing REST API |
| **Best for**          | Small-scale projects                   | Systems with established APIs           |
| **Advantages**        | Simpler setup                          | Reuses existing logic, avoids duplication |
| **Limitations**       | Tight coupling, scales poorly          | Extra network hop, added complexity     |

Overall, Arjan shares these conclusions:
- **Direct access** works well for prototypes but becomes difficult to maintain as systems grow
- **API integration** leverages existing infrastructure but adds communication overhead
- **Auto-conversion** (using tools like `fast_mcp`) can generate MCP servers from FastAPI applications

For concrete coding examples of these approaches, I recommend watching [Arjan's full video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0QIuI1wpes).

I believe MCP represents an important evolution - soon, even internal company tools might include AI interfaces as standard features, fundamentally changing how we interact with software.
