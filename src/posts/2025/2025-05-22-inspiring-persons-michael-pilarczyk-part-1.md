I want to introduce you to someone who has significantly impacted my perspective: Michael Pilarczyk. He has a remarkable ability to articulate and structure the way I generally approach life. I am a genuine admirer of his book, "[Master Your Mindset](https://www.michaelpilarczyk.nl/boeken)", and the powerful ideas it contains, which blend neuroscience, stoicism, Eastern meditation, and modern coaching. The core message is about actively working and training your mindset towards achieving success, building resilience, and finding purpose.

A core conviction he shares, echoing Napoleon Hill's 'Think and Grow Rich', is the power of focused thought and visualisation in attracting opportunities. This principle has manifested in my life multiple times. Most recently, when searching for our current home. We visualised finding a specific type of place, one that met our needs for space, location, and crucially, allowed us to live near my wife's twin sister and her husband. Despite the specific requirements, within a year, we found our dream house in Kerkdriel.

Similarly, setting up our NGO and working in Rwanda and Madagascar involved visualising the goal and actively seeking possibilities. Initially, connections in Africa seemed distant, but by preparing and looking for openings, we unexpectedly connected with inspiring individuals like entrepreneur [Rik Stamhuis](https://mg.linkedin.com/in/rikstamhuis) and the mindful Father Jean Bosco in Nyabinoni, Rwanda, who provided the support and location we needed.

For me, this isn't about magic or passive wishing. It's about the active process of preparing yourself thoroughly, staying alert for even the smallest glimmer of opportunity, and then having the readiness and courage to seize that moment when it arises.

Michael's book, 'Master Your Mindset', offers practical tools for this. Here are some key takeaways:

*   Mindset as “software”: your beliefs shape reality
*   Identify and reframe limiting beliefs
*   Use daily practices: journaling, affirmations, visualisation
*   Design rituals and environment for consistency
*   Apply tiny habits to build unstoppable momentum
*   Embrace discomfort to grow resilience
*   Review and adjust goals regularly

If you're interested in exploring his work further, his Dutch podcast "[Leef je mooiste leven](https://open.spotify.com/show/41RKTinBuriqPUi313sGUq)" is a great resource.

I'm personally looking forward to attending his "[Maximum Potential 2025](https://www.michaelpilarczyk.nl/maximum-potential-2025)" event; very excited about that!
