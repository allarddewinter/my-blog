Yoko Li at a16z discusses how AI is changing software development, moving beyond tooling to a new foundation. This involves rethinking core concepts.

Nine emerging patterns are highlighted:

1.  **AI-native Git:** Version control shifts focus to prompt+test bundles over line changes.
2.  **Dashboards -> Synthesis:** Interfaces become dynamic and conversational via LLMs.
3.  **Docs as interactive knowledge bases:** Documentation serves humans and agents for context.
4.  **Templates to generation:** Custom project scaffolding based on descriptions replaces static templates.
5.  **Beyond .env:** Secrets management moves towards scoped tokens and local brokers for agents.
6.  **Accessibility as the universal interface:** Accessibility APIs may become the primary layer for agent interaction.
7.  **Asynchronous agent work:** Developers orchestrate agents working in the background across the development lifecycle.
8.  **MCP becoming a universal standard:** Model Context Protocol enables tools to expose standard interfaces for agents.
9.  **Abstracted primitives:** Agents use robust, composable services (auth, billing, storage) optimised for agent consumption.

The article states:

> Itâ€™s not just AI layered onto old workflows, but is a redefinition of how software gets built with agents, context, and intent at the core.
