Using the powerful Eleventy Image plugin, we have three ways to optimize images: HTML Transform, Markdown syntax, and a Nunjucks shortcode.

## HTML Transform

Transforms any `<img>` or `<picture>` tags in HTML files as a post-processing step. Find the default settings directly in `eleventy.config.js`.
