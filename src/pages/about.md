## What I Do

## What I Do

My professional journey centres on leveraging technology and strategic thinking to build robust, practical solutions, primarily within the energy sector across Europe and Africa. I am deeply passionate about sustainability and using data and architecture to drive positive change.

As a Technical Authority and Domain Architect, I bridge the gap between technical possibilities and strategic business needs. My work involves shaping technology roadmaps, establishing clear governance, and applying my background in data analytics, data science, and cloud platforms to build scalable and effective systems.

I am driven by the challenge of breaking down complex problems, looking beyond existing boundaries, and providing clear insights that empower teams and deliver tangible value aligned with future goals.

## Why I Build This Website

This website functions as my personal 'linkblog'; a space for exploring ideas at the intersection of technology, strategic thinking, and a positive mindset.

Inspired by approaches like Simon Willison's linkblogging for technology insights, Will Larsen's focus on strategic perspectives, and Michael Pilarczyk's philosophy on mindset, I use this platform to share insights, bookmarks, and reflections. My aim is to explore the principles behind building robust systems (in both organisations and technology), making effective decisions, and cultivating a resilient, optimistic outlook.

It's a bookmarking tool and also a place to process and share thoughts on topics that matter to me professionally and personally, contributing to a clearer understanding of complex areas.
