In his post, "[People > Principles > Process > Product](https://mikefisher.substack.com/p/people-principles-process-product)", Mike Fisher makes a case for the order in which leaders should focus their efforts. He argues that while the natural tendency is to jump straight into fixing or improving the product, this approach is backwards.

> Despite this being most of our natural proclivity, I think it’s backwards. The order in which we should focus is people, principles, process, and then product.

Fisher suggests that true, sustainable success comes from building a solid foundation. This starts with getting the right **people** on the team and fostering trust. Next, you establish the **principles** that guide decision-making and define the culture. With those in place, you can create the **processes** that enable smooth, repeatable execution. Only then, he argues, should the focus shift to the **product**, which becomes the natural outcome of a well-functioning team.

I find this a clear and valuable way to think about delivering a product, whether as a team, department or an entire company. It particularly applies after a reorganisation, when realignment is critical. You might have the same people, but you still need to align on the new principles and processes.

I have seen what happens when you skip these steps. When principles are not well-established, people are left without clear guidance. They often revert to their old ways of working, which may have been effective in a previous structure but are not suited for the new one. They simply do not know any better because the new guiding principles and processes have not been properly established.

> In the end, great products are the byproduct of great teams, clear values, and thoughtful execution. That’s why the product comes last, because when everything else is working, it’s the natural outcome.

Skipping a step or getting the order wrong makes progress difficult. Fisher's framework confirms that the sequence is effective for building products.
