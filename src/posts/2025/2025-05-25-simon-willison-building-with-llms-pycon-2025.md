Came across this neat tutorial on building LLM-powered applications from Simon Willison, which he shared via his newsletter.

The materials cover practical things like setting up and running LLMs from the command line, using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and tool usage. 

Here's a snippet of the topics covered:

> Topics we will cover include:
>
> A review of the best currently available models
> Using multi-modal LLMs to analyze images, audio and video
> Use-cases that LLMs can be effectively applied to
> How to access the most capable models via their various APIs
> Prompt engineering
> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
> LLM tool usage
> Automated evaluations for LLM applications
> The latest options for running local models
